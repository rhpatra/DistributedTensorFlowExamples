# Running distributed Tensorflow
The data is generated by a linear Gaussian model

    y= 2X + 10 + \epsilon

The simpliest least_square-SGD method is used to solve this problem.

## on a local machine
To test a distributed tensorflow on local machine run the script `./run_on_single_machine.sh`. 

The parameter servers need to be shut down by hand for the moment.

## on AWS EC2
To test a distributed tensorflow on AWS EC2, you first need to substitute the server ips/ports with yours in `run_on_cluster.sh` and then run this script  on **each** instances. 

Remark: 
- The AWS instances should allow all traffic for inbound (in Security Group).

# SVM Example
This script SVM_example.py is modified from [Tensorflow Linear Model Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/tutorials/wide/index.html#tensorflow-linear-model-tutorial).

Remark:

- There will be some warnings for Python 3 user because the code in tutorial is written in Python2.
